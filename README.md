# Parking Demonstration

This demonstration project is a python/django backend for a parking
reservation system with the following features:

 + **User registration & login** - New users should be able to create a new account using their email address, set up a password, and set up their phone number.

 + **Parking spot viewing & search interface:** - Provide APIs for users to be able to see available parking spots on a map, search for an address and find nearby unreserved parking, and see how much a particular parking spot costs.
 
 + **Parking spot reservation** - Users should be able to reserve a parking spot, view their reservation, and cancel it. Note that reservation should start immediately.
